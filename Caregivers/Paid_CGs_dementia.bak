Looking at paid caregivers among those with dementia.
Specific aim 1 from Jenny Reckrey's GEMSSTAR project:
"Determine the individual (e.g. functional status, income, insurance status), family (e.g. marital status, number of children), and geographic (e.g. region, state) factors associated with receipt of paid caregiving for persons with dementia."

Pulling initial analyses for abstract submission 3/15/18.
Steps (from email from 3/5/18):
-Start with wave 5 dataset constructed for Jenny's paper on caregivers and homebound status, restricted to those with dementia.
-We want pop estimates, % with paid CG, % 20+ hours paid help per week, source of payment among all.
-Split by paid CG/no paid CG, table 1.
-logit based on significance of bivariate relationships.
